title: Estimating long-term causal effects from short-term experiments and long-term
  observational data with unobserved confounding
section: Poster
openreview: b5GQsfOlxKg
abstract: Understanding and quantifying cause and effect relationships is an important
  problem in many domains. The generally-agreed standard solution to this problem
  is to perform a randomised controlled trial. However, even when randomised controlled
  trials can be performed, they usually have relatively short duration’s due to cost
  considerations. This makes learning long-term causal effects a very challenging
  task in practice, since the long-term outcome is only observed after a long delay.
  In this paper, we study the identification and estimation of long-term treatment
  effects when both experimental and observational data are available. Previous work
  provided an estimation strategy to determine long-term causal effects from such
  data regimes. However, this strategy only works if one assumes there are no unobserved
  confounders in the observational data. In this paper, we specifically address the
  challenging case where unmeasured confounders are present in the observational data.
  Our long-term causal effect estimator is obtained by combining regression residuals
  with short-term experimental outcomes in a specific manner to create an instrumental
  variable, which is then used to quantify the long-term causal effect through instrumental
  variable regression. We prove this estimator is unbiased, and analytically study
  its variance. Finally, we empirically test our approach on synthetic data, as well
  as real-data from the International Stroke Trial. Relevant source code and documentation
