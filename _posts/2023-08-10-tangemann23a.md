title: Unsupervised Object Learning via Common Fate
section: Poster
openreview: h_zobYpaJu
abstract: Learning generative object models from unlabelled videos is a long standing
  problem and required for causal scene modeling. We decompose this problem into three
  easier subtasks, and provide candidate solutions for each of them. Inspired by the
  Common Fate Principle of Gestalt Psychology, we first extract (noisy) masks of moving
  objects via unsupervised motion segmentation. Second, generative models are trained
  on the masks of the background and the moving objects, respectively. Third, background
  and foreground models are combined in a conditional “dead leaves” scene model to
  sample novel scene configurations where occlusions and depth layering arise naturally.
  To evaluate the individual stages, we introduce the FISHBOWL dataset positioned
  between complex real-world scenes and common object-centric benchmarks of simplistic
  objects. We show that our approach learns generative models that generalize beyond
  occlusions present in the input videos and represents scenes in a modular fashion,
  allowing generation of plausible scenes outside the training distribution by permitting,
  for instance, object numbers or densities not observed during training.
