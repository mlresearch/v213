title: Directed Graphical Models and Causal Discovery for Zero-Inflated Data
section: Oral
openreview: wJjI6aetW8D
abstract: With advances in technology, gene expression measurements from single cells
  can be used to gain refined insights into regulatory relationships among genes.
  Directed graphical models are well-suited to explore such (cause-effect) relationships.
  However, statistical analyses of single cell data are complicated by the fact that
  the data often show zero-inflated expression patterns. To address this challenge,
  we propose directed graphical models that are based on Hurdle conditional distributions
  parametrized in terms of polynomials in parent variables and their $0/1$ indicators
  of being zero or nonzero. While directed graphs for Gaussian models are only identifiable
  up to an equivalence class in general, we show that, under a natural and weak assumption,
  the exact directed acyclic graph of our zero-inflated models can be identified.
  We propose methods for graph recovery, apply our model to real single-cell gene
  expression data on T helper cells, and show simulated experiments that validate
  the identifiability and graph estimation methods in practice.
