title: Factual Observation Based Heterogeneity Learning for Counterfactual Prediction
section: Poster
openreview: uKrGYPbjN9N
abstract: Extant causal methods exclusively exploit the heterogeneity based on the
  observed covariates for heterogeneous outcome prediction. Even with nowadays big
  data, the collected covariates may not contain complete confounders. When some confounders
  are absent, the methods can suffer from confounding bias and missing heterogeneity.
  To address these two issues, we propose to leverage the factual observation in the
  observational data to recover the latent confounders. Since the learned confounder
  representation exploits the heterogeneity of latent confounders, it leads to finer
  granular heterogeneous outcome prediction, which is closer to the individual-level
  than prediction conditional on only covariates. Specifically, we propose a novel
  Factual Observation based Heterogeneity Learning (FOHL) algorithm with an encoder
  for confounder representation learning and a decoder for outcome prediction. Theoretical
  analysis reveals the validity of recovering confounders from factual observations
  to make the heterogeneous prediction closer to the individual-level. Furthermore,
  experimental results demonstrate that our FOHL method can outperform the existing
  baselines.
