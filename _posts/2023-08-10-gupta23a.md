title: Can Active Sampling Reduce Causal Confusion in Offline Reinforcement Learning?
section: Poster
openreview: gp2sUQ0uIxx
abstract: Causal confusion is a phenomenon where an agent learns a policy that reflects
  imperfect spurious correlations in the data. Such a policy may falsely appear to
  be optimal during training if most of the training data contain such spurious correlations.
  This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in domains such as robotics, with potentially
  large gaps between the open- and closed-loop performance of an agent. In such settings,
  causally confused models may appear to perform well according to open-loop metrics
  during training but fail catastrophically when deployed in the real world. In this
  paper, we study causal confusion in offline reinforcement learning. We investigate
  whether selectively sampling appropriate points from a dataset of demonstrations
  may enable offline reinforcement learning agents to disambiguate the underlying
  causal mechanisms of the environment, alleviate causal confusion in offline reinforcement
  learning, and produce a safer model for deployment. To answer this question, we
  consider a set of tailored offline reinforcement learning datasets that exhibit
  causal ambiguity and assess the ability of active sampling techniques to reduce
  causal confusion at evaluation. We provide empirical evidence that uniform and active
  sampling techniques are able to consistently reduce causal confusion as training
  progresses and that active sampling is able to do so significantly more efficiently
  than uniform sampling.
