title: A Meta-Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Causal Discovery
section: Poster
openreview: p6NnDqJM_jL
abstract: 'Uncovering the underlying causal structure of a phenomenon, domain or environment
  is of great scientific interest, not least because of the inferences that can be
  derived from such structures. Unfortunately though, given an environment, identifying
  its causal structure poses significant challenges. Amongst those are the need for
  costly interventions and the size of the space of possible structures that has to
  be searched. In this work, we propose a meta-reinforcement learning setup that addresses
  these challenges by learning a causal discovery algorithm, called Meta-Causal Discovery,
  or MCD. We model this algorithm as a policy that is trained on a set of environments
  with known causal structures to perform budgeted interventions. Simultaneously,
  the policy learns to maintain an estimate of the environmentâ€™s causal structure.
  The learned policy can then be used as a causal discovery algorithm to estimate
  the structure of environments in a matter of milliseconds. At test time, our algorithm
  performs well even in environments that induce previously unseen causal structures.
  We empirically show that MCD estimates good graphs compared to SOTA approaches on
  toy environments and thus constitutes a proof-of-concept of learning causal discovery
  algorithms.  '
