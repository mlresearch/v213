title: Causal Discovery with Score Matching on Additive Models with Arbitrary Noise
section: Poster
openreview: rVO0Bx90deu
abstract: 'Causal discovery methods are intrinsically constrained by the set of assumptions
  needed to ensure structure identifiability. Moreover additional restrictions are
  often imposed in order to simplify the inference task: this is the case for the
  Gaussian noise assumption on additive non-linear models, which is common to many
  causal discovery approaches. In this paper we show the shortcomings of inference
  under this hypothesis, analyzing the risk of edge inversion under violation of Gaussianity
  of the noise terms. Then, we propose a novel method for inferring the topological
  ordering of the variables in the causal graph, from data generated according to
  an additive non-linear model with a generic noise distribution. This leads to NoGAM
  (Not only Gaussian Additive noise Models), a causal discovery algorithm with a minimal
  set of assumptions and state of the art performance, experimentally benchmarked
  on synthetic data.'
