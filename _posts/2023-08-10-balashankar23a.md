title: Learning Conditional Granger Causal Temporal Networks
section: Poster
openreview: fslZv3_C7C3
abstract: 'Granger-causality derived from observational time series data is used in
  many real-world applications where timely interventions are infeasible. However,
  discovering Granger-causal links in large temporal networks with a large number
  of nodes and time-lags can lead to <em>millions</em> of time-lagged model parameters,
  which requires us to make sparsity and overlap assumptions. In this paper, we propose
  to learn time-lagged model parameters with the objective of improving recall of
  links, while learning to defer predictions when the overlap assumption is violated
  over observed time series. By learning such conditional time-lagged models, we demonstrate
  a 25% increase in the area under the precision-recall curve for discovering Granger-causal
  links combined with a 18-25% improvement in forecasting accuracy across three popular
  and diverse datasets from different disciplines (DREAM3 gene expression, MoCAP human
  motion recognition and New York Times news-based stock price prediction) with correspondingly
  large temporal networks, over several baseline models including Multivariate Autoregression,
  Neural Granger Causality, Graph Neural Networks and Graph Attention models. The
  observed improvement in Granger-causal link discovery is significant and can potentially
  further improve prediction accuracy and modeling efficiency in downstream real-world
  applications leveraging these popular datasets. '
