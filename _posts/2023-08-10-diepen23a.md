title: 'Beyond the Markov Equivalence Class: Extending Causal Discovery under Latent
  Confounding'
section: Poster
openreview: ELCaHvLyCaR
abstract: In this work, we show how to combine two popular paradigms for causal discovery
  from observational data in the presence of latent confounders in order to arrive
  at a much more informative causal model. Building on the seminal constraint-based
  causal discovery algorithm, FCI, we exploit the power of direct cause-effect pair
  identification to uncover new relationships, which can subsequently be propagated
  to find even more causal links in the rest of the model. This idea has been explored
  before, but until now always under the assumption of no latent confounders. Using
  our new causal direction criterion (CDC), we can finally drop this limitation. We
  derive inference rules for orienting additional cause-effect relations and show
  how to minimize the number of tests during the CDC search. In our experimental evaluations
  over a range of simulated data sets, the resulting FCI-CDC algorithm increases recall
  by between 5%-10% compared to vanilla FCI, without loss in precision.
