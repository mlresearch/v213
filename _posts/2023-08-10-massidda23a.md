title: Causal Abstraction with Soft Interventions
section: Oral
openreview: 53eo778jdtX
abstract: Causal abstraction provides a theory describing how several causal models
  can represent the same system at different levels of detail. Existing theoretical
  proposals limit the analysis of abstract models to "hard" interventions fixing causal
  variables to be constant values. In this work, we extend causal abstraction to "soft"
  interventions, which assign possibly non-constant functions to variables without
  adding new causal connections. Specifically, (i) we generalize $\tau$-abstraction
  from Beckers and Halpern (2019) to soft interventions, (ii) we propose a further
  definition of soft abstraction to ensure a unique map $\omega$ between soft interventions,
  and (iii) we prove that our constructive definition of soft abstraction guarantees
  the intervention map $\omega$ has a specific and necessary explicit form.
