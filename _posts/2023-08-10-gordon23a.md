title: Causal Inference Despite Limited Global Confounding via Mixture Models
section: Poster
openreview: GeounBDhT7S
abstract: 'A Bayesian Network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) on a set of $n$ random
  variables (the vertices); a Bayesian Network Distribution (BND) is a probability
  distribution on the random variables that is Markovian on the graph. A finite $k$-mixture
  of such models is graphically represented by a larger graph which has an additional
  “hidden” (or “latent”) random variable $U$, ranging in $\{1,\ldots,k\}$, and a directed
  edge from $U$ to every other vertex. Models of this type are fundamental to causal
  inference, where $U$ models an unobserved confounding effect of multiple populations,
  obscuring the causal relationships in the observable DAG. By solving the mixture
  problem and recovering the joint probability distribution with $U$, traditionally
  unidentifiable causal relationships become identifiable. Using a reduction to the
  more well-studied “product” case on empty graphs, we give the first algorithm to
  learn mixtures of non-empty DAGs. '
