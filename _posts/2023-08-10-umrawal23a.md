title: Leveraging Causal Graphs for Blocking in Randomized Experiments
section: Poster
openreview: o_SGTjAcVZm
abstract: Randomized experiments are often performed to study the causal effects of
  interest. Blocking is a technique to precisely estimate the causal effects when
  the experimental material is not homogeneous. It involves stratifying the available
  experimental material based on the covariates causing non-homogeneity and then randomizing
  the treatment within those strata (known as blocks). This eliminates the unwanted
  effect of the covariates on the causal effects of interest. We investigate the problem
  of finding a stable set of covariates to be used to form blocks, that minimizes
  the variance of the causal effect estimates. Using the underlying causal graph,
  we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain such a set for a general semi-Markovian
  causal model.
