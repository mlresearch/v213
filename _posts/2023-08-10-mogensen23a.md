title: Instrumental Processes Using Integrated Covariances
section: Poster
openreview: gvj178GOqnd
abstract: Instrumental variable methods are often used for parameter estimation in
  the presence of confounding. They can also be applied in stochastic processes. Instrumental
  variable analysis exploits moment equations to obtain estimators for causal parameters.
  We show that in stochastic processes one can find such moment equations using an
  integrated covariance matrix. This provides new instrumental variable methods, instrumental
  variable methods in a class of continuous-time processes as well as a unified treatment
  of discrete- and continuous-time processes.
