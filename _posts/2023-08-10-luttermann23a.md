title: Practical Algorithms for Orientations of Partially Directed Graphical Models
section: Poster
openreview: IHy5pAGuzP4
abstract: In observational studies, the true causal model is typically unknown and
  needs to be estimated from available observational and limited experimental data.
  In such cases, the learned causal model is commonly represented as a partially directed
  acyclic graph (PDAG), which contains both directed and undirected edges indicating
  uncertainty of causal relations between random variables. The main focus of this
  paper is on the maximal orientation task, which, for a given PDAG, aims to orient
  the undirected edges maximally such that the resulting graph represents the same
  Markov equivalent DAGs as the input PDAG. This task is a subroutine used frequently
  in causal discovery, e.g., as the final step of the celebrated PC algorithm. Utilizing
  connections to the problem of finding a consistent DAG extension of a PDAG, we derive
  faster algorithms for computing the maximal orientation by proposing two novel approaches
  for extending PDAGs, both constructed with an emphasis on simplicity and practical
  effectiveness.
