title: Causal Learning through Deliberate Undersampling
section: Poster
openreview: vfUSpAFyEC
abstract: 'Domain scientists interested in causal mechanisms are usually limited by
  the frequency at which they can collect the measurements of social, physical, or
  biological systems. A common and plausible assumption is that higher measurement
  frequencies are the only way to gain more informative data about  the underlying
  dynamical causal structure. This assumption is a strong driver for designing new,
  faster instruments, but such instruments might not be feasible or even possible.
  In this paper, we show that this assumption is incorrect: there are situations in
  which we can gain additional information about the causal structure by measuring
  more <em>slowly</em> than our current instruments. We present an algorithm that
  uses graphs at multiple measurement timescales to infer underlying causal structure,
  and show that inclusion of structures at slower timescales can nonetheless reduce
  the size of the equivalence class of possible causal structures. We provide simulation
  data about the probability of cases in which deliberate undersampling yields a gain,
  as well as the size of this gain. '
