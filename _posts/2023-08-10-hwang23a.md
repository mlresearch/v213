title: On Discovery of Local Independence over Continuous Variables via Neural Contextual
  Decomposition
section: Poster
openreview: "-aFd28Uy9td"
abstract: 'Conditional independence provides a way to understand causal relationships
  among the variables of interest. An underlying system may exhibit more fine-grained
  causal relationships especially between a variable and its parents, which will be
  called the local independence relationships. One of the most widely studied local
  relationships is Context-Specific Independence (CSI), which holds in a specific
  assignment of conditioned variables. However, its applicability is often limited
  since it does not allow continuous variables: data conditioned to the specific value
  of a continuous variable contains few instances, if not none, making it infeasible
  to test independence. In this work, we define and characterize the local independence
  relationship that holds in a specific set of joint assignments of parental variables,
  which we call context-set specific independence (CSSI). We then provide a canonical
  representation of CSSI and prove its fundamental properties. Based on our theoretical
  findings, we cast the problem of discovering multiple CSSI relationships in a system
  as finding a partition of the joint outcome space. Finally, we propose a novel method,
  coined neural contextual decomposition (NCD), which learns such partition by imposing
  each set to induce CSSI via modeling a conditional distribution. We empirically
  demonstrate that the proposed method successfully discovers the ground truth local
  independence relationships in both synthetic dataset and complex system reflecting
  the real-world physical dynamics.'
