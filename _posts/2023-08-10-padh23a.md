title: Stochastic Causal Programming for Bounding Treatment Effects
section: Oral
openreview: iop8rRYtggi
abstract: 'Causal effect estimation is important for many tasks in the natural and
  social sciences. We design algorithms for the continuous partial identification
  problem: bounding the effects of multivariate, continuous treatments when unmeasured
  confounding makes identification impossible. Specifically, we cast causal effects
  as objective functions within a constrained optimization problem, and minimize/maximize
  these functions to obtain bounds. We combine flexible learning algorithms with Monte
  Carlo methods to implement a family of solutions under the name of stochastic causal
  programming. In particular, we show how the generic framework can be efficiently
  formulated in settings where auxiliary variables are clustered into pre-treatment
  and post-treatment sets, where no fine-grained causal graph can be easily specified.
  In these settings, we can avoid the need for fully specifying the distribution family
  of hidden common causes. Monte Carlo computation is also much simplified, leading
  to algorithms which are more computationally stable against alternatives.'
