title: Generalizing Clinical Trials with Convex Hulls
section: Oral
openreview: O1OO9jgomC
abstract: Randomized clinical trials eliminate confounding but impose strict exclusion
  criteria that limit recruitment to a subset of the population. Observational datasets
  are more inclusive but suffer from confounding â€“ often providing overly optimistic
  estimates of treatment response over time due to partially optimized physician prescribing
  patterns. We therefore assume that the unconfounded treatment response lies somewhere
  in between the observational estimate before and the observational estimate after
  treatment assignment. This assumption allows us to extrapolate results from exclusive
  trials to the broader population by analyzing observational and trial data simultaneously
  using an algorithm called Optimum in Convex Hulls (OCH). OCH represents the treatment
  effect either in terms of convex hulls of conditional expectations or convex hulls
  (also known as mixtures) of conditional densities. The algorithm first learns the
  component expectations or densities using the observational data and then learns
  the linear mixing coefficients using trial data in order to approximate the true
  treatment effect; theory importantly explains why this linear combination should
  hold. OCH estimates the treatment effect in terms both expectations and densities
  with state of the art accuracy.
