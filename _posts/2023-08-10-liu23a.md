title: 'Causal Triplet: An Open Challenge for Intervention-centric Causal Representation
  Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: HAYU8TRYTCb
abstract: 'Recent years have seen a surge of interest in learning high-level causal
  representations from low-level image pairs under interventions. Yet, existing efforts
  are largely limited to simple synthetic settings that are far away from real-world
  problems. In this paper, we present CausalTriplet, a causal representation learning
  benchmark featuring not only visually more complex scenes, but also two crucial
  desiderata commonly overlooked in previous works: (i) an actionable counterfactual
  setting, where only certain (object-level) variables allow for counterfactual observations
  whereas others do not; (ii) an interventional downstream task with an emphasis on
  out-of-distribution robustness from the independent causal mechanisms principle.
  Through extensive experiments, we find that models built with the knowledge of disentangled
  or object-centric representations significantly outperform their distributed counterparts.
  However, recent causal representation learning methods still struggle to identify
  such latent structures, indicating substantial challenges and opportunities in CausalTriplet.
