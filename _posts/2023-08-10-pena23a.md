title: Factorization of the Partial Covariance in Singly-Connected Path Diagrams
section: Poster
openreview: Li1YI-hmSxO
abstract: We extend path analysis by showing that, for a singly-connected path diagram,
  the partial covariance of two random variables factorizes over the nodes and edges
  in the path between the variables. This result allows us to determine the contribution
  of each node and edge to the partial covariance. It also allows us to show that
  Simpson’s paradox cannot occur in singly-connected path diagrams.
