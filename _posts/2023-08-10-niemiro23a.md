title: Local Dependence Graphs for Discrete Time Processes
section: Poster
openreview: 65RQJK6N1lb
abstract: 'Local dependence graphs for discrete time processes encapsulate information
  concerning the dependence relationships between the past of the multidimensional
  process and its present state and as such can represent feedback loops.  Even in
  the discrete time setting some natural questions relating the conditional (in)dependence
  statements in the stochastic process to separation properties of the underlying
  local dependence graph are scattered throughout the literature. We provide an unifying
  view and fill in certain gaps. In this paper we examine graphical characteristics
  for two kinds of conditional independences: those occurring in Markov chains under
  the stationary regime and independences between the past of one subprocess and the
  future of another given the past of the third subprocess. '
