title: On the Interventional Kullback-Leibler Divergence
section: Poster
openreview: xiWeCmZkEkF
abstract: Modern machine learning approaches excel in static settings where a large
  amount of i.i.d. training data are available for a given task. In a dynamic environment
  though, an intelligent agent needs to be able to transfer knowledge and re-use learned
  components across domains. It has been argued that this may be possible through
  causal models, aiming to mirror the modularity of the real world in terms of independent
  causal mechanisms. However, the true causal structure underlying a given set of
  data is generally not identifiable, so it is desirable to have means to quantify
  differences between models (e.g., between the ground truth and an estimate), on
  both the observational and interventional level. In the present work, we introduce
  the Interventional Kullback-Leibler (IKL) divergence to quantify both structural
  and distributional differences between models based on a finite set of multi-environment
  distributions generated by interventions from the ground truth.  Since we generally
  cannot quantify all differences between causal models for every finite set of interventional
  distributions, we propose a sufficient condition on the intervention targets to
  identify subsets of observed variables on which the models provably agree or disagree.
