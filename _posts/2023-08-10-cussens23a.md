title: Branch-Price-and-Cut for Causal Discovery
section: Poster
openreview: cZK80bf781S
abstract: " We show how to extend the integer programming (IP) approach to score-based
  causal discovery by including pricing. Pricing allows the addition of new IP variables
  during solving, rather than requiring them all to be present initially. The dual
  values of acyclicity constraints allow this addition to be done in a principled
  way. We have extended the GOBNILP algorithm to effect a branch-price-and-cut method
  for DAG learning. Empirical results show that implementing a delayed pricing approach
  can be beneficial. The current pricing algorithm in GOBNILP is slow, so further
  work on fast pricing is required."
