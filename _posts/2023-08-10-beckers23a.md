title: Causal Models with Constraints
section: Poster
openreview: 5wwmrXe64c
abstract: Causal models have proven extremely useful in offering formal representations
  of causal relationships between a set of variables. Yet in many situations, there
  are non-causal relationships among variables. For example, we may want variables
  $LDL$, $HDL$, and $TOT$ that represent the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
  the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol level,
  with the relation $LDL+HDL = TOT$. This cannot be done in standard causal models,
  because we can intervene simultaneously on all three variables. The goal of this
  paper is to extend standard causal models to allow for constraints on settings of
  variables. Although the extension is relatively straightforward, to make it useful
  we have to define a new intervention operation that disconnects a variable from
  a causal equation. We give examples showing the usefulness of this extension, and
  provide a sound and complete axiomatization for causal models with constraints.
