title: An Algorithm and Complexity Results for Causal Unit Selection
section: Oral
openreview: 7QQoXWu-JDB
abstract: The unit selection problem aims to identify objects, called units, that
  are most likely to exhibit a desired mode of behavior when subjected to stimuli
  (e.g., customers who are about to churn but would change their mind if encouraged).
  Unit selection with counterfactual objective functions was introduced relatively
  recently with existing work focusing on bounding a specific class of objective functions,
  called the benefit functions, based on observational and interventional dataâ€”assuming
  a fully specified model is not available to evaluate these functions. We complement
  this line of work by proposing the first exact algorithm for finding optimal units
  given a broad class of causal objective functions and a fully specified structural
  causal model (SCM). We show that unit selection under this class of objective functions
  is $\mbox{NP}^{\mbox{PP}}$-complete but is NP-complete when unit variables correspond
  to all exogenous variables in the SCM. We also provide treewidth-based complexity
  bounds on our proposed algorithm while relating it to a well-known algorithm for
  Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference.
