title: Scalable Causal Discovery with Score Matching
section: Poster
openreview: 6VvoDjLBPQV
abstract: 'This paper demonstrates how to discover the whole causal graph from the
  second derivative of the log-likelihood in observational non-linear additive Gaussian
  noise models. Leveraging scalable machine learning approaches to approximate the
  score function $\nabla \operatorname{log}p(\mathbf{X})$, we extend the work of Rolland
  et al. (2022) that only recovers the topological order from the score and requires
  an expensive pruning step removing spurious edges among those admitted by the ordering.
  Our analysis leads to DAS (acronym for Discovery At Scale), a practical algorithm
  that reduces the complexity of the pruning by a factor proportional to the graph
  size. In practice, DAS achieves competitive accuracy with current state-of-the-art
  while being over an order of magnitude faster. Overall, our approach enables principled
  and scalable causal discovery, significantly lowering the compute bar. '
