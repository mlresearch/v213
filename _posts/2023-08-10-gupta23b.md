title: Local Causal Discovery for Estimating Causal Effects
section: Poster
openreview: f_NwqOLpUCu
abstract: Even when the causal graph underlying our data is unknown, we can use observational
  data to narrow down the possible values that an average treatment effect (ATE) can
  take by (1) identifying the graph up to a Markov equivalence class; and (2) estimating
  that ATE for each graph in the class. While the PC algorithm can identify this class
  under strong faithfulness assumptions, it can be computationally prohibitive. Fortunately,
  only the local graph structure around the treatment is required to identify the
  set of possible ATE values, a fact exploited by local discovery algorithms to improve
  computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Local Discovery using Eager
  Collider Checks (LDECC), a new local causal discovery algorithm that leverages unshielded
  colliders to orient the treatmentâ€™s parents differently from existing methods. We
  show that there exist graphs where LDECC exponentially outperforms existing local
  discovery algorithms and vice versa. Moreover, we show that LDECC and existing algorithms
  rely on different faithfulness assumptions, leveraging this insight to weaken the
  assumptions for identifying the set of possible ATE values.
