title: Non-parametric identifiability and sensitivity analysis of synthetic control
  models
section: Poster
openreview: wo-9DgR8mSF
abstract: Quantifying cause and effect relationships is an important problem in many
  domains, from medicine to economics. The gold standard solution to this problem
  is to conduct a randomised controlled trial. However, in many situations such trials
  cannot be performed. In the absence of such trials, many methods have been devised
  to quantify the causal impact of an intervention from observational data given certain
  assumptions. One widely used method are synthetic control models. While identifiability
  of the causal estimand in such models has been obtained from a range of assumptions,
  it is widely and implicitly assumed that the underlying assumptions are satisfied
  for all time periods both pre- and post-intervention. This is a strong assumption,
  as synthetic control models can only be learned in pre-intervention period. In this
  paper we address this challenge, and prove identifiability can be obtained without
  the need for this assumption, by showing it follows from the principle of invariant
  causal mechanisms. Moreover, for the first time, we formulate and study synthetic
  control models in Pearl’s structural causal model framework. Importantly, we provide
  a general framework for sensitivity analysis of synthetic control causal inference
  to violations of the assumptions underlying non-parametric identifiability. We end
  by providing an empirical demonstration of our sensitivity analysis framework on
  simulated and real data.
