title: Backtracking Counterfactuals
section: Oral
openreview: stVikewRRvw
abstract: Counterfactual reasoning—envisioning hypothetical scenarios, or possible
  worlds, where some circumstances are different from what (f)actually occurred (counter-to-fact)—is
  ubiquitous in human cognition. Conventionally, counterfactually-altered circumstances
  have been treated as “small miracles” that locally violate the laws of nature while
  sharing the same initial conditions. In Pearl’s structural causal model (SCM) framework
  this is made mathematically rigorous via interventions that modify the causal laws
  while the values of exogenous variables are shared. In recent years, however, this
  purely interventionist account of counterfactuals has increasingly come under scrutiny
  from both philosophers and psychologists. Instead, they suggest a backtracking account
  of counterfactuals, according to which the causal laws remain unchanged in the counterfactual
  world; differences to the factual world are instead “backtracked” to altered initial
  conditions (exogenous variables). In the present work, we explore and formalise
  this alternative mode of counterfactual reasoning within the SCM framework. Despite
  ample evidence that humans backtrack, the present work constitutes, to the best
  of our knowledge, the first general account and algorithmisation of backtracking
  counterfactuals. We discuss our backtracking semantics in the context of related
  literature and draw connections to recent developments in explainable artificial
  intelligence (XAI).
