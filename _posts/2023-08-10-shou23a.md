title: Influence-Aware Attention for Multivariate Temporal Point Processes
section: Poster
openreview: O6lke-lyluT
abstract: Identifying the subset of events that influence events of interest from
  continuous time datasets is of great interest in various applications. Existing
  methods however often fail to produce accurate and interpretable results in a time-efficient
  manner. In this paper, we propose a neural model – Influence-Aware Attention for
  Multivariate Temporal Point Processes (IAA-MTPPs) – which leverages the powerful
  attention mechanism in transformers to capture temporal dynamics between event types,
  which is different from existing instance-to-instance attentions, using variational
  inference while maintaining interpretability. Given event sequences and a prior
  influence matrix, IAA-MTPP efficiently learns an approximate posterior by an Attention-to-Influence
  mechanism, and subsequently models the conditional likelihood of the sequences given
  a sampled influence through an Influence-to-Attention formulation. Both steps are
  completed efficiently inside a B-block multi-head self-attention layer, thus our
  end-to-end training with parallelizable transformer architecture enables faster
  training compared to sequential models such as RNNs. We demonstrate strong empirical
  performance compared to existing baselines on multiple synthetic and real benchmarks,
  including qualitative analysis for an application in decentralized finance.
