title: Causal Discovery for Non-stationary Non-linear Time Series Data Using Just-In-Time
  Modeling
section: Poster
openreview: aGmh4Y8wtl
abstract: Causal discovery from multivariate continuous time-series data is becoming
  more important as the amount of IoT data to analyze increases. However, it is not
  easy to identify the causal structure from such data using conventional linear causal
  discovery methods due to their non-stationary characteristics such as distribution
  shifts, and non-linearity of the system dynamics. The application of non-linear
  causal discovery methods is also generally limited, and there are still some problems
  such as their computational complexity, interpretability, and robustness for non-stationarity.
  To address these challenges, we propose a new causal discovery method JIT-LiNGAM,
  based on the Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM) and the Just-In-Time (JIT)
  framework, which is also called Lazy-Learning or Model-On-Demand. Our method estimates
  a local linear structural causal model from neighboring samples of the past data
  every time a new input sample is given. Approximating an inherently globally non-linear
  model with local linear models, we can benefit from high detection performance of
  causal relationship for non-linear and non-stationary data, improvements of interpretability
  of causal effects by linear expression, and reduced computational complexity. We
  formulate this algorithm based on Taylorâ€™s theorem, and show effective neighbor
  selection algorithms by a simple experiment. The results of numerical experiments
  using artificial data with non-linearity and non-stationarity demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our method compared to representative methods for such data, under some general
  evaluation metrics.
