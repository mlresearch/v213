title: Sample-Specific Root Causal Inference with Latent Variables
section: Poster
openreview: aLquhg7Jmo
abstract: Root causal analysis seeks to identify the set of initial perturbations
  that induce an unwanted outcome. In prior work, we defined sample-specific root
  causes of disease using exogenous error terms that predict a diagnosis in a structural
  equation model. We rigorously quantified predictivity using Shapley values. However,
  the associated algorithms for inferring root causes assume no latent confounding.
  We relax this assumption by permitting confounding among the predictors. We then
  introduce a corresponding procedure called Extract Errors with Latents (EEL) for
  recovering the error terms up to contamination by other error terms lying on certain
  paths under the linear non-Gaussian acyclic model. EEL also identifies the smallest
  sets of dependent errors for fast computation of the Shapley values. The algorithm
  bypasses the hard problem of estimating the underlying causal graph in both cases.
  Experiments highlight the superior accuracy and robustness of EEL relative to its
  predecessors.
