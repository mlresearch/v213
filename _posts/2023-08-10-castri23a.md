title: Enhancing Causal Discovery from Robot Sensor Data in Dynamic Scenarios
section: Poster
openreview: NUMhk05ljqw
abstract: Identifying the main features and learning the causal relationships of a
  dynamic system from time-series of sensor data are key problems in many real-world
  robot applications. In this paper, we propose an extension of a state-of-the-art
  causal discovery method, PCMCI, embedding an additional feature-selection module
  based on transfer entropy. Starting from a prefixed set of variables, the new algorithm
  reconstructs the causal model of the observed system by considering only its main
  features and neglecting those deemed unnecessary for understanding the evolution
  of the system. We first validate the method on a toy problem and on synthetic data
  of brain network, for which the ground-truth models are available, and then on a
  real-world robotics scenario using a large-scale time-series dataset of human trajectories.
  The experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
  technique in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing better and
  faster causal discovery of meaningful models from robot sensor data.
