title: Causal Inference under Interference and Model Uncertainty
section: Poster
openreview: TYKk9SWhke0
abstract: Algorithms that take data as input commonly assume that variables in the
  input dataset are Independent and Identically Distributed (IID). However, IID may
  be violated in many real world datasets that are generated by processes in which
  units/samples interact with one another. Typical examples include contagion that
  may be related to infectious diseases in public health, economic crisis in finance
  and risky behavior in social science. Handling non-IID data (without making additional
  assumptions) requires access to the true data generating process and the exact interaction
  patterns among units/samples, which may not be easily available. This work focuses
  on a specific type of interaction among samples, namely interference (i.e. some
  units’ treatments affect other units’ outcomes), in situations where there exists
  uncertainty regarding interaction patterns. The main contributions include modeling
  uncertain interaction using linear graphical causal models, quantifying bias when
  IID is incorrectly assumed, presenting a procedure to remove such bias and deriving
  bounds for average causal effects.
