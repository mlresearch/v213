title: Image-based Treatment Effect Heterogeneity
section: Poster
openreview: Dkhvt7ICgs
abstract: 'Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for
  estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of interventions. One important use
  of RCTs is to study the causes of global poverty – a subject explicitly cited in
  the 2019 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel
  awarded to Duflo, Banerjee, and Kremer “for their experimental approach to alleviating
  global poverty.” Because the ATE is a population summary, researchers often want
  to better understand how the treatment effect varies across different populations
  by conditioning on tabular variables such as age and ethnicity that were measured
  during the RCT data collection. Although such variables carry substantive importance,
  they are often only observed only near the time of the experiment: exclusive use
  of such variables may fail to capture historical, geographical, or neighborhood-specific
  contributors to effect variation. In global poverty research, when the geographical
  location of the experiment units is approximately known, satellite imagery can provide
  a window into such historical and geographical factors important for understanding
  heterogeneity. However, there is no causal inference method that specifically enables
  applied researchers to analyze Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) from
  images. In this paper, we develop a deep probabilistic modeling framework that identifies
  clusters of images with similar treatment effect distributions, enabling researchers
  to analyze treatment effect variation by image. Our interpretable image CATE model
  also emphasizes an image sensitivity factor that quantifies the importance of image
  segments in contributing to the mean effect cluster prediction. We compare the proposed
  methods against alternatives in simulation; additionally, we show how the model
  works in an actual RCT, estimating the effects of an anti-poverty intervention in
  northern Uganda and obtaining a posterior predictive distribution over treatment
  effects for the rest of the country where no experimental data was collected. We
  make code for all modeling strategies available in an open-source software package
  and discuss their applicability in other domains (such as the biomedical sciences)
  where image data are also prevalent.'
