title: Evaluating Temporal Observation-Based Causal Discovery Techniques Applied to
  Road Driver Behaviour
section: Poster
openreview: EKCNNPE3ssQ
abstract: Autonomous robots are required to reason about the behaviour of dynamic
  agents in their environment. The creation of models to describe these relationships
  is typically accomplished through the application of causal discovery techniques.
  However, as it stands observational causal discovery techniques struggle to adequately
  cope with conditions such as causal sparsity and non-stationarity typically seen
  during online usage in autonomous agent domains. Meanwhile, interventional techniques
  are not always feasible due to domain restrictions. In order to better explore the
  issues facing observational techniques and promote further discussion of these topics
  we carry out a benchmark across 10 contemporary observational temporal causal discovery
  methods in the domain of autonomous driving. By evaluating these methods upon causal
  scenes drawn from real world datasets in addition to those generated synthetically
  we highlight where improvements need to be made in order to facilitate the application
  of causal discovery techniques to the aforementioned use-cases. Finally, we discuss
  potential directions for future work that could help better tackle the difficulties
  currently experienced by state of the art techniques.
